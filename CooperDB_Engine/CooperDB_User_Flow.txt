1) User sumbits a request to create a database:
    input:
        {
            wallet: address
            database_name: address
        }
2) CooperDB generates a unique connection sting and generates a funding wallet and returns that to the admin
    return:
        {
            result: OK
            data: {
                connection_string: "connection string",
                database: "database"
                generated_wallet: "wallet_address"
                private_key: "private_key"
            }
        }
3) Admin is required to store the wallet private key and the unique identifier for future storage requests.
4) Any subsequent updates to the db should be accompanied by the connection string.
